- Figure out why there's two of the same entities in the client
  - Probably sent the message twice, but why?
  - Client should ignore dupes, too
- Remove the libgdx client -- it's out of date and not working
- Archetypes should use an s-tree (or any s-exp) for definition -- or Groovy?
- Behavior system to script entities like doors.
  - Legit don't remember how I was going to compose this system.
  - BehaviorSystem.execute(BehaviorComponent) ->
    BehaviorComponent(val behaviors: listOf(BehaviorComponent)) ??
  - Behaviors have state? Or should pass all parameters as function calls?
    - Behaviors should store data across Components
    - Therefore, no internal state
    - Therefore, a single Behavior instance per behavior
    - BehaviorRegistry analogus to ArchetypeRegistery?
    - map.json: how do objects specify their behaviors...?
  - COMPLETE WHEN:
    - Can open a door
      - Trigger animation
      - Update entity state after a certain point (eg remove collision component)
    - Can pass through door
  - RIP trello board or where-ever the fuck i was writing this shit down
