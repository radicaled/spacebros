    BehaviorComponent(val behaviors: listOf(BehaviorComponent)) ?? (X)
  - Behaviors have state? Or should pass all parameters as function calls? (X)
    - Behaviors should store data across Components (X)
    - Therefore, no internal state (X)
    - Therefore, a single Behavior instance per behavior (X)
    - BehaviorRegistry analogus to ArchetypeRegistery? (X)
    - map.json: how do objects specify their behaviors...? (X)
  - COMPLETE WHEN:
    - Can open a door (X)
      - Trigger animation
      - Update entity state after a certain point (eg remove collision component)
    - Can pass through door (X)
  - RIP trello board or where-ever the fuck i was writing this shit down (X)
 
 - WORST TODO LIST EVER HOW DO I MARK THINGS OFF (X)
